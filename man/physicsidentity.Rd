\title{Students' physics identity dataset}
\description{
In this study, students' physics identity was defined based on two close-ended items asking the students' study time for physics and the experienced family recognition when they are studying physics.
}
\usage{data(physicsidentity)}
\format{
  A data frame with 497 observations on the following 2 physics identity items.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{PHYIDE1}}{When did you study physics outside schools? 1 = Most of the time, 2 = Night before the physics schedule, 3 = Night before exam, 4 = Never}
    \item{\code{PHYIDE2}}{Did your parents support you while studying physics? 1 = Yes, 2 = Lack of parental support, 3 = Extremely no}
