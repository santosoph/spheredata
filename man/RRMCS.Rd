\title{The Rotational and Rolling Motion Conceptual Survey (RRMCS) dataset}
\description{
The RRMCS could be given to explore studentsâ€™ ideas in various education levels starting in high school to introductory college. It examines students' understanding of rotational motion and notions associated with it through 30 multiple choice items.
