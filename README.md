# SPHERE: Students' Performance Data in Physics Education Research

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/spheredata)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spheredata/)

The package contains SPHERE dataset available at [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/88d7m2fv7p/1](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/88d7m2fv7p/1).
It contains students' conceptual understanding, scientific ability, and scientific attitude on physics.
We employed some research based assessments (RBAs) to produce SPHERE including the Force Concept Inventory, the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation, 
the Rotational and Rolling Motion Conceptual Survey, the Fluid Mechanics Concept Inventory, the Mechanical Waves Conceptual Survey, 
the Thermal Concept Evaluation, the Survey of Thermodynamic Processes and First and Second Laws, the Scientific Abilities Assessment Rubrics, 
and the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey. Students' attributes related to gender, age, socioeconomic status, domicile, literacy, 
physics identity, and test results administered using teachers' developed items are also reported in this dataset.
